> Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can.  
That is the only secret of style.  
— [Matthew Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Arnold)

## Why is clear and concise writing important?

Understanding what you are presenting requires some effort for the reader. If an assignment is well written the reader can focus completely on understanding the content. If an assignment is poorly written, the reader must use energy just to decipher what you are saying, and may have no energy left to understand the actual scientific discoveries you are presenting. In the case of research reports and other university-level writing, this can have implications for the grade you earn.
