Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible**, file-based Web-platform.  There is **Zero** installation required.  Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running.  It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, but has a different design philosophy than most. Grav comes with a powerful **Package Management System** to allow for simple installation and upgrading of plugins and themes, as well as simple updating of Grav itself.

The underlying architecture of Grav is designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include:

* [Twig Templating](https://twig.symfony.com/): for powerful control of the user interface
* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): for easy content creation
* [YAML](https://yaml.org): for simple configuration
* [Parsedown](https://parsedown.org/): for fast Markdown and Markdown Extra support
* [Doctrine Cache](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/caching.html): layer for performance
* [Pimple Dependency Injection Container](https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple): for extensibility and maintainability
* [Symfony Event Dispatcher](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher/introduction.html): for plugin event handling
* [Symfony Console](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html): for CLI interface
* [Gregwar Image Library](https://github.com/Gregwar/Image): for dynamic image manipulation

# Requirements

- PHP 7.3.6 or higher. Check the [required modules list](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/requirements#php-requirements)
- Check the [Apache](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/requirements#apache-requirements) or [IIS](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/requirements#iis-requirements) requirements

# Documentation

The full documentation can be found from [learn.getgrav.org](https://learn.getgrav.org).

# QuickStart

These are the options to get Grav:

### Downloading a Grav Package

You can download a **ready-built** package from the [Downloads page on https://getgrav.org](https://getgrav.org/downloads)

### With Composer

You can create a new project with the latest **stable** Grav release with the following command:

```bash
composer create-project getgrav/grav ~/webroot/grav
```

### From GitHub

1. Clone the Grav repository from [https://github.com/getgrav/grav]() to a folder in the webroot of your server, e.g. `~/webroot/grav`. Launch a **terminal** or **console** and navigate to the webroot folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/webroot
   git clone https://github.com/getgrav/grav.git
   ```

2. Install the **plugin** and **theme dependencies** by using the [Grav CLI application](https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-cli) `bin/grav`:
   ```bash
   cd ~/webroot/grav
   bin/grav install
   ```

Check out the [install procedures](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/installation) for more information.

# Adding Functionality

You can download [plugins](https://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins) or [themes](https://getgrav.org/downloads/themes) manually from the appropriate tab on the [Downloads page on https://getgrav.org](https://getgrav.org/downloads), but the preferred solution is to use the [Grav Package Manager](https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) or `GPM`:

```bash
bin/gpm index
```

This will display all the available plugins and then you can install one or more with:

```bash
bin/gpm install <plugin/theme>
```

# Updating

To update Grav you should use the [Grav Package Manager](https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) or `GPM`:

```bash
bin/gpm selfupgrade
```

To update plugins and themes:

```bash
bin/gpm update
```

# Running Tests

First install the dev dependencies by running `composer install` from the Grav root.

Then `composer test` will run the Unit Tests, which should be always executed successfully on any site.
Windows users should use the `composer test-windows` command.
You can also run a single unit test file, e.g. `composer test tests/unit/Grav/Common/AssetsTest.php`

To run phpstan tests, you should run:

* `composer phpstan` for global tests
* `composer phpstan-framework` for more strict tests
* `composer phpstan-plugins` to test all installed plugins
